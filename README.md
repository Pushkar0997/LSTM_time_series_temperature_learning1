# 🌡️ LSTM Time Series Temperature Forecasting

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast temperature time series data using TensorFlow and Keras. The notebook processes and visualizes weather data, trains an LSTM model, and makes temperature predictions.

## 📁 File Overview

- `LSTM_Time_Series_Temperature_Forecasting.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code pipeline — from data loading and preprocessing to model training and forecasting.

## 🔧 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for time series
- Data normalization and reshaping for LSTM input
- Building a deep LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of prediction vs. actual data

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow & Keras

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the notebook:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LSTM_Time_Series_Temperature_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells step by step to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize forecasts.

> 💡 **Note**: Ensure you have all required Python libraries installed. You can use the following to install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📈 Sample Output

The model predicts future temperature trends based on past data, visualized with line plots comparing actual vs. predicted values.
